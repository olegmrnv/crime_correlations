What's the weather like as we approach the equator?
#

Analysis

#

As expected, the weather becomes significantly warmer as one approaches the equator (0 Deg. Latitude). More interestingly, however, is the fact that the southern hemisphere tends to be warmer this time of year than the northern hemisphere. This may be due to the tilt of the earth. In the below images, the equator is represented by the "0" mark.

#

There is no strong relationship between latitude and cloudiness. However, it is interesting to see that a strong band of cities sits at 0, 80, and 100% cloudiness.

There is no strong relationship between latitude and wind speed. However, in the northern hemispheres there is a flurry of cities with over 20 mph of wind.

There is no strong relationship between latitude and humidity. However, of the cities sampled, the majority of them have 60 - 100 % humidity levels.
